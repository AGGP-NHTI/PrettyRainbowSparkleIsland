SEED HUNTER Instructions
(Inside The Vault / Unity Challenge)

1. Setup

In order to make sure everything runs as intended, please assign correct HDRenderPipelineAsset:

Edit > Project Settings > Graphics > Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings

Select "HDRenderPipelineAsset_SeedHunter" from Polygonautic/SeedHunter/Settings

It is recommended to use HDRP 4.10.0 or above.


2. Assets Organization

All graphical assets are located in respective Art folders, further categorized into logical sub-folders for easier navigation.

Each asset shares same unique name across prefab, model, textures, material and Painter project.

We are using these prefixes for quicker search:

env_ (environmental assets, split into Hallway and Chamber categories)
prop_ (detailed prop assets, split into several categories)
coll_ (lowpoly collision models)
tile_ (seamless textures and materials that are not dependant on unique models UVs)
decal_ (textures and materials used for Decal Projectors)
cookie_ (textures used for Light Cookies)
pattern_ (utility textures for various effects and masks)
DetailMap_ (textures with specific channels to be used as Detail Maps only in Lit shader - materials are only for showcase purposes)
Emissive_ (common emissive materials that are not dependant on unique models UVs)


3. Demo Scenes

Two scenes are included: AssetShowcase and SeedHunter

AssetShowcase is filled with all the prefabs that were used in building the SeedHunter scene. You can explore each module / asset on it's own.

SeedHunter is a complex real-time scene with lighting, effects, post-processes and further showcases what is possible to build from provided assets.


4. Substance Painter Projects

With all the source Substance Painter files (.spp) project would be immensely large (over 10 GB), so we made them downloadable separately.

You can grab these Painter sources here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/h44p6xegs06hr77/InsideTheVault_SeedHunter_SubstancePainterProjects.zip?dl=0


5. Shaders

Included is a simple vertex animation shader for Grass created in ShaderGraph.

In order for shader to work, you need to have a ShaderGraph package installed. There is also a classic Lit material for Grass set as default.

It is recommended to use ShaderGraph 4.10.0 or above.
